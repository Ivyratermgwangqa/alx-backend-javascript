# ALX Backend JavaScript - ES6 Basics

Welcome to the "ALX Backend JavaScript" project focused on ECMAScript 6 (ES6). This project explores fundamental ES6 features, demonstrating their usage through a variety of JavaScript exercises.

## Project Overview

This project covers the following ES6 concepts:
- Constants (`const`) and block-scoped variables (`let`)
- Arrow functions
- Default and rest parameters
- Spread syntax
- String templating with template literals
- Object shorthand and computed property names
- For...of loops and iterators
- Object creation and method properties

## Setup

To run this project, you need Node.js and npm. As of now, Node.js 18 is the recommended version due to its Long-Term Support (LTS) status. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo apt install nodejs -y
   ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies**:
   After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## How to Run the Project

To execute the JavaScript files, you can use Node.js. Here's an example of running one of the tasks:

```bash
node 0x00-ES6_basic/0-constants.js
```

To run the entire project or test specific functionalities, you can utilize a task runner or a testing framework like Jest.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into multiple tasks, with each task contained in a separate JavaScript file. Here's the structure:
